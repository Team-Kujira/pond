### Increasing the GHOST borrow rates
To simulate interest rate changes on GHOST you first need to deposit some money into the vault and then borrow as much as possible against it.
You can do this using the CLI and execute txs manually or you can use the [planfile](../README.md#planfiles) to mock it on deployment.
